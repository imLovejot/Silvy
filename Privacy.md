This Privacy Policy governs the collection, use, and disclosure of information by the Discord bot ("Silvy") and its associated services provided by the developer.

## Information Collected

### Types of Information

- **Discord User ID:** Used for unique user identification, managing AFK status, and storing user preferences. For example, Silvy stores user preferences such as language settings or specific command preferences to enhance user experience.
  
- **Server Information:** Data about Discord servers, including server ID, name, and member list, utilized for functionalities such as welcome messages, automod settings, and module interactions requiring server-specific details. This includes storing server settings like automod configurations or welcome message templates customized by server administrators.

- **User Input:** Users may voluntarily provide additional information through commands or interactions with Silvy. For instance, users may set custom preferences or provide feedback via specific commands that Silvy processes and stores to improve user satisfaction and service delivery.

### Cookies and Tracking

Silvy does not use cookies or any form of tracking technology to collect user information outside of Discord's standard API functionalities. We rely solely on Discord's API for information retrieval and interaction tracking within Discord servers.

## Use of Information

The collected information is used for the following purposes:

- **Providing Services:** Maintaining and delivering Silvy's functionalities, such as managing AFK status, handling welcome messages, and facilitating other module functionalities tailored to user and server preferences.
